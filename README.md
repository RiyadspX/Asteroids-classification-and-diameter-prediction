# Asteroid Classification and Diameter Prediction

This repository contains an end-to-end implementation of machine learning models for asteroid classification and diameter prediction, inspired by the paper **"Machine Learning Approaches for Classification and Diameter Prediction of Asteroids"** by Mir Sakhawat Hossain and Md. Akib Zabed. The project utilizes the [Asteroid Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sakhawat18/asteroid-dataset).

## **Project Overview**

The primary goals of this project are:
- **Asteroid Classification:** Predict the classification of asteroids into 13 distinct groups using supervised learning algorithms.
- **Diameter Prediction:** Estimate asteroid diameters based on features like absolute magnitude (H) and geometric albedo.
- **End-to-End Workflow:** Integrate the machine learning models with a user-friendly interface and deploy the application using Docker.

---

## **Features**
- Implementation of multiple ML models for classification and regression.
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) for feature engineering.
- Interactive user interface to visualize and predict asteroid properties.
- Dockerized application for easy deployment.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Core language for development.
- **Machine Learning**: Libraries like Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and TensorFlow.
- **Web Interface**: Flask or Streamlit for the front end.
- **Containerization**: Docker for deployment.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib and Seaborn for EDA.
